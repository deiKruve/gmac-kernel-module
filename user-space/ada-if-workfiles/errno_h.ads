  -- The includer defined __need_Emath if he wants only the definitions
  --   of EDOM and ERANGE, and not everything else.   

  -- Get the error number constants from the system-specific file.
  --   This file will test __need_Emath and _ERRNO_H.   

  -- Declare the `errno' variable, unless it's defined as a macro by
  --   bits/errno.h.  This is the case in GNU, where it is a per-thread
  --   variable.  This redeclaration using the macro still works, but it
  --   will be a function declaration without a prototype and may trigger
  --   a -Wstrict-prototypes warning.   

  -- The full and simple forms of the name with which the program was
  --   invoked.  These variables are set up automatically at startup based on
  --   the value of ARGV[0] (this works only if you use GNU ld).
