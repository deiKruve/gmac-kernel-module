  -- Linux has no ENOTSUP error code.   
  -- Older Linux versions also had no ECANCELED error code.   
  -- Support for error codes to support robust mutexes was added later, too.   
  -- Function to get address of global `errno' variable.   
   --  skipped func __errno_location

  -- When using threads, errno is a per-thread value.   
  -- This is ugly but the kernel header is not clean enough.  We must
  --   define only the values EDOM, EILSEQ and ERANGE in case __need_Emath is
  --   defined.
